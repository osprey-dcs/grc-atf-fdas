Deliver a Data Acquisition System that provides up to 1,024 analog signals that are sampled and archived at 250 kHz. A DAQ cycle must record up to 15 minutes and the system must provide storage for up to 15 testing cycles. Each data set must be selectable and exported in CSV or UFF58 format. 

During a DAQ cycle, up to 16 signals must be available for monitoring and the data correlation between any two signals must be within 100 nanoseconds. The signals available for real time monitoring are selectable. The signals may be viewed as either vectors of 10k samples each or FFTs of 10k samples each. There must be real time monitoring of peak values for each signal.

Archived data sets shall be selectable from metadata including time stamps. A selected data set must be available for export. The data management must allow deletion of sets.

All software and firmware is provided along with the system. It must be open-source. Any code that is delivered from an open-source project will include location of the repository and version number in use.
