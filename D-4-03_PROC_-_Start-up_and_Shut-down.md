## Note on Computer Shutdown

Each computer may be requested to shutdown gracefully by one of the following methods

- Press and quickly release power button.  See Reference photos section below for button locations.
- Issue a `sudo poweroff`
- For Workstations only.  Select `Shutdown` from the system menu (lower left corner)

## System Power Down

Preparation for partial/total power outage.

If possible, save open documents on Workstations.

1. Switch off power to all 32x Quartz Chassis in the Instrument room
1. Initiate a graceful shutdown of each computer by one of the means listed above.
    1. DAQS server (Instrument room)
    1. MISC server (Control room)
    1. Workstation 1 (Control room)
    1. Workstation 2 (Control room)
1. Wait for computers to complete normal shutdown.
    - Indicated by power LEDs turning off
    - If this takes more than 5 minutes, endeavor to contact support
    - If support is unavailable in the available time,
      press and hold power button until LEDs turn off.

## System Power Up

Recovery from partial/total power outage.

1. Verify power to:
   - Control room switch (visible from front)
   - Instrument room switch (visible from rear)
   - Instrument room Time Server
1. Wait for Time Server lock
   - GPS Status should show: `IN: GPS` and `GPS: LOCK`
   - Current UTC time incrementing
1. Press and quickly release power buttons on computers
    - DAQS server
    - MISC server
    - Workstation 1
    - Workstation 2
1. Switch on power to all Quartz Chassis
1. Verify Workstation boot (repeat for each)
    1. Connect KVM console to Workstation 1 or 2
    1. Should see Desktop (autologin to default user)
    1. Use the icon on Desktop to launch the `Phoebus` application.
    1. Select the `Main` tab.
1. Check that the Archiver is running

    1. Click on `Reports` and select `Currently disconnected PVs`
    1. Notify support if result table has entries other than: "no data found"
1. Open a terminal and run:
    1. `ssh DAQ`
    1. `sudo ethtool -L DAQeth0 tx 1 rx 32 combined 0`
    1. `exit`
1. Proceed to [Inspecting the Current State and Health](healthcheck.md) of the system.
