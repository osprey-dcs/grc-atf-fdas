System,Requirement,Notes
All Computers,Linux compatibility,"Refer to OEM documentation.  Particular attention should be paid to RAID controller, graphics card."
,,
Workstation computers,19-inch rack mount,
,HDMI video card,Needs to be interoperable with KVM system.  Able to decode EDID data generated by KVM virtual display.
,USB 2.0 port,Needs to be interoperable with KVM system.  For emulated keyboard/mouse
,Ethernet >= 1Gbps full duplex,
,,
Network switches,,
,Sufficient 10Gbps ports,Minimum 2x in instrument room.  1X in computer room
,Sufficient 1Gbps ports,See network diagram
,>= 8 Gbps switch backplane bandwidth,
,Disk replacement,Contact system OEM for compatibility information when selecting replacement for an individual disk in a RAID array.
,,
DAQ Server,10Gbps network card,Prefer NIC with multiple inbound packet queues.  Number equal to number of CPU cores up to number of Quartz chassis.  Allows more concurrent handling of ADC data.
,Data disk array >= 750MB/s sustained sequential write bandwidth,Prefer “mixed use” or “write intensive” SSD.
,,
Time server,,
,Must support IPv4,Quartz firmware supports IPv4
,Must act as NTPv3 server ,Quartz firmware acts as NTPv3 client
,GPS Receiver,Type N antenna connector.  Prefer option to “fly wheel” while no signal.
,IRIG Decoder,"Must support modulation and protocol variant currently provided by ATF.  At time of delivery, IRIG-B 1KHz AM modulation."
,Must provide pulse-per-second signal with the following,
,"PPS: 5V TTL, active high (rising edge is start of second) ",
,PPS: Minimum pulse duration 16ns ,Maximum is 16ns less than 1 second
,PPS: pulse to pulse jitter <= 20ns RMS ,
,,
MISC Server,>=2x Ethernet >= 1Gbps,Second NIC used for data export PC
